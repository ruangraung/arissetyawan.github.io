excerpt: Photos of eating and food on social media will indeed portray us more cool
  in the presence of global villagers. Being cool is a means of generation 2.0 looking
  happy. But it is worth pondering, what if the coolness is hypocracy? A kind of our
  self-esteem to cover up the fact that there are actually still many things about
  humanity that we miss talking about behind the beauty of the food picture.

<p>One<br />
of my parents' main tips - and perhaps everyone's parents - as a<br />
child was not to forget to pray before eating. The advice then<br />
becomes a ritual that everyone applies before eating, begging the<br />
Almighty that the food eaten becomes a blessing for the body. This<br />
prayer is coated with gratitude because it is still able to chew the<br />
crispy broccoli and tempeh fried today when <a href="http://www.worldometers.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more<br />
than 20 thousand people die</a> because<br />
they do not have food to eat.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As<br />
they mature, the ritual of praying before eating changes. Me and you<br />
are The generation that lives closely with the interaction in the<br />
internet universe. Today's generation lives in a global village with<br />
the latest devices for connecting virtual networks.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>
In<br />
order to support our virtual friendship network, the ritual of<br />
praying before eating is forced to succumb to a new ritual that is<br />
more important: taking photos of food that has been served with a<br />
camera device, tinkering with a few photos with Vscocam software to<br />
look more enjoyable, then share them with the media social so that<br />
the entire network of virtual friends around the world can see it.<br />
After that, we pray—or some<br />
people forget to pray—and<br />
eat the food.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>
Eating<br />
is no longer just a matter of meeting the basic needs of nutrition<br />
for the body. Eating is an affirmation of the existence of generation<br />
2.0. Means of looking happy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>
But<br />
isn't eating a part of culture? Just like music or traveling<br />
that should be imaged and talked about is not only a matter of basic<br />
needs, but also the socio-cultural that surrounds the rite of eating<br />
along with the variety of food patterns? So it's okay to upload<br />
photos of food and food to social media, right?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Legitimate.<br />
Not wrong at all. But let's contemplate the habit of uploading our<br />
food photos by understanding the columnist's Zen<br />
RS<br />
idea, when discussing <a href="http://digital.jawapos.co.id/shared.php?type=imap&amp;date=20151013&amp;name=H2-A233043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traveling</a><br />
which<br />
is also loved by the 2.0 generation. In his essay Zen blamed the<br />
behavior of the young people today is similar to the <em>mooi<br />
indie</em><br />
painting model of the Dutch East Indies era. This type of painting<br />
only depicts the beauty of the Indies as a paradise whose contents<br />
are merely beautiful, forgetting deeper discussion of various<br />
socio-political problems and the turmoil of the archipelago.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>
Likewise<br />
traveling, generation 2.0 according to Zen struggles in the case of<br />
beauty of tourist attractions that must be preserved its beauty and<br />
distributed to the world through social media.Travel is a matter of<br />
looking for pleasure, where travelers 2.0 have learned the humanistic<br />
sides of residents who live in tourist areas, or how horizontal<br />
conflicts between residents vs. citizens and citizens vs. countries<br />
occur in some of these tourist areas.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>
Three-quarter<br />
money with a traveling case discussed by Zen RS,<br />
could be a case of eating and food generation 2.0 is a form of <em>mooi<br />
indie</em>. A 1: 1 scale food photo on<br />
our Instagram is an attempt to portray the beauty of Archipelago’s<br />
food, or western hemisphere food that we eat on the Indonesian<br />
mainland. This habit seems even more adorable because what we are<br />
after is the number of 'love signs' or 'thumbs' that other people<br />
pinned to our photos, not the interaction of discussing the ritual of<br />
eating in the comments column. How do other people want to comment<br />
and discuss if our photo caption does not slip the seeds for the<br />
discussion?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>
I<br />
often observe Instagram accounts whose contents are 'eating stories'<br />
and other matters of foodporn. Photo Caption? Do not expect there<br />
will be a slick narrative <em>a la</em><br />
Bondan Winarno or Anthony Bourdain. Instead of its contents simply an<br />
invitation to eat, eat, and eat. Sometimes for those who are<br />
observant enough to observe, will understand that the photo and<br />
caption is advertorial, the account owner is paid to advertise. The<br />
advertisement is shrouded in genuine testimonials.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>
The<br />
case of uploading food photos on social media is no longer the<br />
existential of young people. There is a velocity of money in it,<br />
between the owner of a restaurant or diner and the owner of a social<br />
media account (read: buzzer). The contents of the comments column are<br />
even more interesting, containing young people who marked their<br />
friends, some with the invitation "wow, let's eat here",<br />
and other similar comments.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Returning<br />
to the previous discussion, a collection of photos of food on social<br />
media will become a cultural matter if we talk about the cultural<br />
elements and not just hunt for 'signs of love' or 'look good'<br />
comments. In one of his writings on his blog, chef and culinary<br />
writer, the<br />
late<br />
<a href="http://anthonybourdain.tumblr.com/post/122071979918/back-to-beirut" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anthony<br />
Bourdain</a> ,<br />
explains how the process of documenting the world of culinary<br />
changing.<br />
Previously, Bourdain only described the enjoyment of each meal. Later<br />
this tattooed man understands: eating cannot be separated from<br />
culture. That the case of eating and food is able to tell the social<br />
and political independence of the community owner.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>
This<br />
shift can then be seen from television programs that Bourdain<br />
fostered. For example, in one episode of Parts<br />
Unknown , when Bourdain visited Hanoi.<br />
Instead of just telling the exoticism of Vietnamese street food,<br />
Bourdain also explores how the condition of the country that was<br />
repeatedly plagued by the war. In between sipping the delicious sauce<br />
of Bun Cha<br />
with President Barack Obama in a tavern, Bourdain also explained how<br />
the relationship between Vietnam and the United States, two countries<br />
that were hostile in the great war. Bourdain neatly describes how the<br />
tradition of Vietnamese food is now side by side with American fast<br />
food restaurants.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Imagine,<br />
how neat if our food and food photos on social media or blogs are<br />
accompanied by narratives about how these foods exist in the<br />
community, or sudden awareness of 'this country is not fine' when<br />
<em>Sayur<br />
asem </em>that<br />
we cook fail to cook because LPG runs out and we have trouble finding<br />
replacement gas around the house. Starting with a <em>baper</em><br />
story about <em>sayur<br />
asem </em>failing<br />
to cook can provoke discussion with other global village audiences<br />
that <a href="https://faisalbasri.com/2015/05/14/keganjilan-bisnis-lpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our<br />
oil and gas governance is problematic</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Is<br />
not this extraordinary, we can train the sensitivity of our<br />
discussion and analysis of the country's problems from food and food<br />
photos. We can tell the story of Indonesian people to the world like<br />
when <a href="http://nuranwibisono.net/2015/06/pagi-dimulai-dari-soto-pak-syamsul/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuran<br />
Wibisono</a>  slipped<br />
the story of Pak Syamsul, a soto craftsman who migrated from East<br />
Java to Yogyakarta. Behind the narration of how delicious a bowl of<br />
soto with beef brisket and a piece of fried lungs is an interesting<br />
human story included.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Photos<br />
of eating and food on social media will indeed portray us more cool<br />
in the presence of global villagers. Being cool is a means of<br />
generation 2.0 looking happy. But it is worth pondering, what if the<br />
coolness is hypocracy? A kind of our self-esteem to cover up the fact<br />
that there are actually still many things about humanity that we miss<br />
talking about behind the beauty of the food picture. Are we willing<br />
to ignore the story of humanity in order to get many 'signs of love'<br />
and 'thumbs up'? and<br />
the pseudo stamp is called 'cool' and 'present'?</p>
