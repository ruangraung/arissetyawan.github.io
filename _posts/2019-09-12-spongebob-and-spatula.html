I once watched an interesting film called <em>Life in a Day</em>. This<br />
film involves many people from various parts of the world who are<br />
asked to record interesting moments in their lives on the same date,<br />
July 24, 2010, then send it to be combined into a timeline of human<br />
life within 24 hours. The film was made from 4,500 hours of footage<br />
in 80,000 videos sent from 192 countries. Every person in every<br />
country has different habits, cultures and lives.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>
What makes this film interesting is the expertise of the filmmaker to<br />
make a kind of common thread that unites each different picture frame<br />
of many people with different cultures and habits, into a unified<br />
whole of a human's life journey in a day from sunrise to sunset.</p>

<p>
Everything's connected. There is a connection between human life in<br />
one part of the world and another. What happens in this part of the<br />
world here actually also affects parts of the world there. At least<br />
in the science of international relations can be proven by the fact<br />
that the political policy of a superpower will affect the lives of<br />
millions of people in third world countries. Or the war that occurred<br />
in the Middle East could cause oil prices to skyrocket and make the<br />
government of a country forced to raise fuel prices for the safety of<br />
the State Budget</p>

I have always believed that a writer's job is to look for connections<br />
between stories around the world. It is the writer's obligation to<br />
explore the story of A from area A, explore B story from region B,<br />
then look for the common thread between A and B, then arrange it into<br />
one unified whole story. A writing that can be read by many people so<br />
that those who did not previously understand can suddenly understand<br />
that there is a correlation between story A and story B.</p>

In one episode, the yellow Spongebob Squarepants broke his spatula.<br />
Tool that is usually used to flip a patty that is being baked. When<br />
he lost his tool, Spongebob immediately felt miserable. He lost his<br />
heirloom, his main tool for work. Spongebob experienced what was<br />
called <em>Chef’s Block</em>, my fictional term to refer to<br />
conditions when a chef cannot cook anymore. What made Spongebob<br />
unable to cook again was not only because it lost the physical shape<br />
of the spatula, but there was something behind it: spirit. This is<br />
even more fatal, when he loses enthusiasm which usually triggers him<br />
to cook cheerfully.</p>

In the world of authorship also known as writer’s block. A<br />
condition when a writer stuck and unable to think of an idea again to<br />
set forth in a series of meaningful scripts. Lately I am like a<br />
Spongebob who lost his spatula. I lost the spirit and mood to write<br />
something. I stuck, hit the wall of ideas. Unable to jump over it.</p>

<p>
This full random thought writing is my attempt to explore my spirit<br />
and writing mood again. And also just a filler so that this blog does<br />
not vacuum too long. If you following this blog, of course you can<br />
see that it's been a long time since I posted the last post. Since<br />
then I experienced writer’s block.</p>

<p> Hopefully after this last post I immediately determine the direction: what should I do? Maybe I should be a Spongebob who takes a break, picnic to the jellyfish fields and look for fun there. After that who knows I can get a new spatula, including a new work spirit and mood.</p>
